* middleName
* family
* gender
* nationality
* tel
* fatherName
* motherName
* address

* role
* registrationNum
* nationalCode
* economicCode
* type
* enterpriseCode
* founderName
* licenceNum
* technicalName
* contactList
* medicalNumber
* proficiency
* employeeCode
* employmentStartDate
* position // this will depricate in final version
* <span class="highlight">mainPosition</span> // added in this version
* <span class="highlight">subPosition</span> // added in this version
* idCardNum
* citizenshipNumber
* birthDate
* cityOfBirth
* countryOfBirth
* signature
* enterprise
* job
* title

1. `entityName` in all person APIs is a required field
2. `entityName` is an Enum, it'll only accept the following properties:
   1. `doctors`
   2. `samplers`
   3. `personnel`
   4. `contacts`
   5. `patients`
   6. `users`

   1. `male`
   2. `female`
   3. `unknown`

## rules & conventions
1. if any API returns a body with `status` key equals to `1`, it can be considered as a successful operation for the main purpose of that API

### createPerson
```
POST [HOST]/person3/createPerson HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "entityName": "doctors", // Enum
    "name": "kia", // string
    "family": "nsx", // string
    "idCardNum": "00100233669", // number
    "gender": "male", // Enum

}
```

### readPerson
```
GET [HOST]/person3/_id/61b22537024997b2d7bcda9d
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kia-nasirzadeh/ashkan-nasirzadeh.ir/gh-pages/_posts/colife-backend/readPerson.png)
e.g. to get a person with _id=61b22537024997b2d7bcda9d:

### listPersons
you can use this api for different purposes:
##### 1- to get a list of some entity (e.g. contacts like the following picture)
```
POST [HOST]/person3/list HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "mode": "all&count", // string
    "limit": 10,
    "page": 1, // number
    "entityName": "doctors"
}
// it will return a list of contacts with following keys:
// employeeCode,
// name,
// family,
// employmentStartDate,
// employmentEndDate,
// mainPosition,
// subPosition,
// job,
// and a also a key called "count"
```
above example displays how you can get 10 rows of "contacts" for page one

##### 2- gouping

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kia-nasirzadeh/ashkan-nasirzadeh.ir/gh-pages/_posts/colife-backend/listPersons.png)

```
POST [HOST]/person3/list HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "mode": "grouping&all&count", // string
    "limit": 10,
    "page": 1, // number
    "entityName": "doctors", // entityName Enum
    "groupingKey": "job",
    "groupingVal": "programmers" // string
}
// it will return a list of contacts with following keys:
// employeeCode,
// name,
// family,
// employmentStartDate,
// employmentEndDate,
// mainPosition,
// subPosition,
// job,
// and a also a key called "count"
```
above example displays how you can get 10 rows of “contacts”  for page one, it'll show just programmers
`groupingVal` will be an Enum in next versions but now we have not enough sources

**note:** if you don't set `page` it'll get 1 automatically

---
### updatePerson
in this API you can update a person with his _id
```
PATCH [HOST]/person3/updatePerson HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "_id" "lksjropur9328n98"
    "tel1": 32483947, // number
    "tel2": 2343209483, // number
    "mail": "a@b.c", // vali email string
    "fatherName": "mehrdad", // string
    "motherName": "helen", // string
    "countryOfBirth": "iran",
    "cityOfBirth": "tehran",
    "citizenshipNumber": 1234324, // number
    "job": "programmer"
}
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kia-nasirzadeh/ashkan-nasirzadeh.ir/gh-pages/_posts/colife-backend/updatePerson.png)

---
### delPerson
```
DELETE [HOST]/person3/delPerson/61c822c57ac8f731f2a29b7c HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json
```
this will return the recent object you deleted with status one Or an empty object with just status 0 if your request id don't match any document in DB or a completely empty object if you didn't provide any "_id" key for it
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kia-nasirzadeh/ashkan-nasirzadeh.ir/gh-pages/_posts/colife-backend/listPersons%26MainPage.png)

---
### personExists
```
GET [HOST]/person3/createPerson HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "key": "_id",
    "val": "61b22537024997b2d7bcda9d"
}
```
**this is just a helper api, we will remove this in production**
since we are also using this api service in backend, if there is no data it won't return a json, just null(no data)
in the above example we want to check if a person with _id equal to "61b22537024997b2d7bcda9d" exists, you can use this with other persons key/vals e.g. check if a person exists with entityName="doctors", actually if it return true, it's indicating db has at list one person who is a doctor! and so like that

another possible option is :

{ "status": 2, "message": "not valid key" }

---
### searchWithConds
maybe this API is more challenging, we may have multiple conditions, turns out that we can break these conditions in two group for the sake of simplicity.
`andKeys`: a two dimensional array of conditions whose must be met together at the same time
`orKeys`: a two dimensional array of conditions whose can be met with others or not
every singleton of these conditions is nothing but a member of a two-dimensional array which is the original filtering array, let's see one of these conditions:
```
{
    "limit": 10,
    "page": 1,
    "andKeys": [
        ["cityOfBirth", "california", "="],
        ["countryOfBirth", "usa", "="]
    ],
    "entityName": "doctors"
}
```

---
### search
```
POST [HOST]/person3/search HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "keys[0]": "name"
    "searchText": "a"
}

```
above example returns everybody who his first name included "a"
```
POST [HOST]/person3/search HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "keys[0]": "name"
    "keys[1]": "family"
    "searchText": "a"
}

```
above example returns everybody who his first or last name included "a"
